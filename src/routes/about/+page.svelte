			Tokeneyes Labs is the brainchild of Cordelle, a passionate advocate of web 3 and all things
			crypto. Having noticed the lack of originality and too much copy-and-paste in the web 3 world,
			Cordelle decided to inject some personality into the industry. <br /> <br /> In early 2022, he
			began drawing his favorite cryptocurrencies, giving them faces for fun, but soon forgot about
			them. Months later, he was struck with an idea - why not give all cryptocurrencies a unique
			personality? And that's how Tokeneyes Labs came to be. <br />
			<br />
			With Cordelle's passion and creativity at the helm, Tokeneyes Labs promises to bring a fresh perspective
			to the crypto world and add some much-needed personality to the industry.
